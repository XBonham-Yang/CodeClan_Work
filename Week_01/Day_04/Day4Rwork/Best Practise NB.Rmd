`start with library that you need`


` label sections  `
shows lines to devide things up 
_shft cmd r_ works on script doesn't work on notebook


`align things `
_cmd  I_
helps to align things 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

amount_spent <- c(9.1, 8.55, 14.32, 14.17, 14.34, 7.97, 9.79, 11.47, 12.44)
activities <- c(
  "Lunch", "Dinner", "Lunch",
  "Lunch", "Cinema", "Drinks",
  "Lunch", "Lunch", "Dinner"
)

my_week_of_spending <- tibble(
  amount_spent = amount_spent,
  spending_category = activities
)
# this is the total amount of money spent
total_spend <- summarise(
  my_week_of_spending,
  sum(amount_spent)
)
# this is the money spent on lunch
lunch_spend <- summarise(
  filter(my_week_of_spending, spending_category == "Lunch"),
  sum(amount_spent)
)
```
```{r}

```
